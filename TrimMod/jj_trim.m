%JJ_TRIM   Trim point determination of a nonlinear ordinary differential
%equation system
%
%   [X_TR, U_TR, D_TR, Y_TR] = JJ_TRIM (SYS, X, U, D, Y, I_X, I_U, I_D, I_Y, X_NAM, U_NAM, D_NAM, Y_NAM)
%   trims the system SYS towards an operating point defined by the elements
%   of
%   X (state vector), U (input vector), D (derivative of the state vector),
%   and Y (output vector).
%   I_X and I_U define the indices of the so-called trim variables, which
%   are those states and inputs the trim algorithm has to find
%   the appropriate values for. Specified values of the trim variables
%   are taken as initial starting guesses for the iteration.
%   I_D and I_Y are the indices of the so-called trim requirements, which
%   the trim algorithm has to satisfy. The values of the other D(i) and Y(i)
%   do not matter.
%   X_NAM, U_NAM, D_NAM, and Y_NAM are cell arrays of the form
%   X_NAM = {'state_1'; 'state_2'; ...}
%   containing the names of the states, inputs, derivatives, and outputs.
%   The names can be chosen arbitrarily. They are used only to identify
%   linear dependent trim variables or trim requirements.
%
%   IMPORTANT: o There have to be as many trim variables as there are
%                trim requirements.
%
%              o All vectors (and cell arrays) have to be column vectors.
%
%   [X_TR, U_TR, D_TR, Y_TR, ERRFLG] = JJ_TRIM (SYS, ...)
%   ERRFLG = 0 if trimming was successful,
%   ERRFLG = 1 if an error occurred during trimming.
%              The returned trim result is invalid.
%
%   [X_TR, ..., ERRFLG, INFOSTRUCT] = JJ_TRIM (SYS, ...)
%   additionally returns an INFOSTRUCT structure containing
%   - x: the progression of all states,
%   - u: the progression of all inputs,
%   - d: the progression of all state derivatives,
%   - y: the progression of all outputs
%   over all iterations. They are of size N x (N_iter+1) where N is the
%   respective vector length (number of states, inputs etc.) and N_iter is
%   the number of iterations. The first column of each quantity represents
%   the initial point (before the first iteration).
%
%   - n_iter: the total number of iterations
%
%   - trimVars: the list of trim variables (cell array of strings)
%
%   - trimReqs: the list of trim requirements (cell array of strings)
%
%   - cost:   the progression of the cost function (length: N_iter+1)
%
%   - jaco:   the progression of the Jacobian as a cell array of N_iter
%			  cells, each cell containing the Jacobian (size N_t_v x N_t_v)
%             of the current iteration, where N_t_v is the number of trim
%			  variables / trim requirements.
%             The rows represent trim variables (as listed in trimVars),
%             the columns represent the trim requirements (as listed in
%             trimReqs).
%
%             Note that the Jacobian is not updated if the cost function
%             deteriorated from the previous step (StepType 2, see below).
%             In this case, an empty  matrix is stored instead.
%
%   - StepType: enumeration for the type of each step:
%         1: regular iteration
%         2: bisection to recover from a previous iteration step which lead
%            to an increased cost function
%         3: bisection to recover from a previous iteration step which lead
%            to a rank-deficient Jacobian even though the Jacobian had full
%            rank at the/a previous step
%    The i-th entry of StepType corresponds to the step from x(i) and u(i)
%    to x(i+1) and u(i+1).
%
%   - BisecCounter: number of bisections (including the current step) since
%                   the last successful iteration
%
%   - LimitedStep: flag indicating if the step size was truncated:
%     	 0: step was not truncated
%        1: step was truncated to the user-specified step size (DEL_X_MAX
%           and/or DEL_U_MAX)
%        2: step was truncated to avoid violation of upper or lower bounds
%           (X_MIN, X_MAX, U_MIN, or U_MAX)
%        3: step was truncated because of step size limitations AND hard
%           bounds.
%
%   - ExitCode: enumeration for the (reasons of) success or failure of the
%               trimming process:
%     	 0: successful trim
%        1: trim failed:  singular Jacobian at problem setup
%        2: trim failed:  max. number of bisections reached when trying to
%                         restore a regular Jacobian
%        3: trim failed:  max. number of bisections reached when trying to
%                         reduce the cost function
%        4: trim failed:  max. number of iterations reached
%        5: trim failed:  no more step possible in the required direction
%                         without violating the specified bounds
%
% 	- OutputMessage: string or cell of strings containing a detailed message
%                    about the trim result.
%
%
%   [X_TR, ...] = JJ_TRIM (..., Y_NAM, DEL_X_MAX, DEL_U_MAX)
%   allows the additional specification of maximum (absolute) step sizes of
%   states and inputs between consecutive iterations.
%   The lengths of DEL_X_MAX and DEL_U_MAX must be equal to those of
%   X and U respectively.
%   The default values of DEL_X_MAX and DEL_U_MAX are 1e42.
%
%   [X_TR, ...] = JJ_TRIM (..., DEL_U_MAX, DEL_X_LIN, DEL_U_LIN)
%   allows the additional specification of the state and input perturbations
%   to be used for the calculation of the Jacobian matrix (sensitivity matrix)
%   in the linearization procedure. Their length must match the respective
%   lengths of x and u. All elements must be nonzero and are automatically
%   treated as absolute values. The default values of DEL_X_LIN and DEL_U_LIN
%   are 1e-6*(1 + abs(x)) and 1e-6*(1 + abs(u)), respectively.
%
%   [X_TR, ...] = JJ_TRIM (..., DEL_U_LIN, OPTIONS)
%   allows the specification of additional options via designated fields of
%   the OPTIONS structure:
%   n_iter_max:   	the maximum number of iterations (default: 42)
%
%   cost_tbg:       the cost value to be gained (default: 1e-9)
%
%   CompileFlag:    flag {0,1,2} to control if/how to compile the model (default: 1)
%       o flag = 0: model is not compiled by jj_trim (hence needs to be precompiled)
%       o flag = 1: model is compiled by jj_trim using the 'compile' command.
%                   This is the default option in order to be backward
%                   compatible with jj_trim version 1.5 and lower.
%       o flag = 2: model is compiled by jj_trim using the 'lincompile'
%                   command. Recommended e.g. if the model incorporates time
%                   delay blocks to be used with direct feedthrough during
%                   linearization.
%
%   EnableMessages: flag to disable (0) or enable (~=0) message boxes and
%                   console messages. Messages are enabled by default. Note that
%                   disabling messages will make the function completely silent.
%
%	n_bisec_max:	Maximum number of consecutive bisections (default: 10)
%
%   If a field is not set (i.e. is not part of the structure), the
%   respective default value is used.
%   In order to maintain backward compatibility with jj_trim versions 1.5
%   and below, it is also possible to define OPTIONS as a 2-element vector.
%   In this case the following definition applies:
%	- OPTIONS(1): the maximum number of iterations (default: 42)
%   - OPTIONS(2): the cost value to be gained (default: 1e-9)
%   If OPTIONS is passed as a vector, it is not possible to set CompileFlag,
%   EnableMessages, or n_bisec_max, and their default values will be used.
%
%   OPTIONS can also be passed as an empty vector [], in which case the
%   default values will be used.
%
%
%   [X_TR, ...] = JJ_TRIM (..., OPTIONS, X_MIN, X_MAX, U_MIN, U_MAX)
%   allows the additional specification of fixed upper and lower boundaries
%   for states x and inputs u. They can be defined as vectors, in this case
%   their lengths must match the respective lengths of x and u.
%   You can use an empty vector [] to use the default values: -inf for
%   X_MIN and U_MIN, and inf for X_MAX and U_MAX, respectively.
%
%
%   Function dependencies:
%   1. jj_lin (for linearization)
%   2. getGeneralizedOutputVector (model evaluation)
%
%
%   Notes:
%   Unfortunately, Simulink claims the right to alter the order of the states
%   during the simulation (see https://mathworks.com/help/simulink/gui/initial-state.html).
%   MathWorks hence recommends not to use arrays for initialization. There
%   are different solutions to circumvent this; one solution is converting
%   the array to a structure (additionally features the corresponding state
%   names) and initializing the model using this structure as shown below:
%
%   u_tr_with_zero = [0, u_tr']; % add a zero as the time span trailing the input vector
%   x_tr_string = mat2str (x_tr, 42); % convert the state trim vector to a string with maximum precision:16
% 
%   set_param(sys,'LoadInitialState','on');  % enable the checkboxes in the Initial state...
%   set_param(sys,'LoadExternalInput','on'); % and Input menu entry of the current model
%   set_param(sys,'InitialState',x_tr_string ); % transfer the state trim vector to the corresponding edit text
%   set_param(sys,'SaveFormat','Structure'); % set the SaveFormat to Structure
% 
%   x_tr_structure = Simulink.BlockDiagram.getInitialState(sys); % reread the initial state back as a structure into a new variable
%   model_workspace = get_param(sys,'ModelWorkspace'); % retrieve a handle to the model workspace
% 
%   assignin(model_workspace,'initial_state_in_model_workspace',x_tr_structure); % write the initial state (as a structure)...
%   assignin(model_workspace,'initial_input_in_model_workspace',u_tr_with_zero); % and the initial input (as a vector) to the model
% 
%   set_param(app.model_name,'ExternalInput','initial_input_in_model_workspace'); % use these model workspace variables...
%   set_param(app.model_name,'InitialState','initial_state_in_model_workspace');  % in the Input and Initial state edit texts

%   Version 2.3.1   16.01.2024, D. Kiehn
%   - After setting 'InitInArrayFormatMsg' to 'none' (in newer Matlab/Simulink
%     versions), the model is now marked as unchanged ('dirty' = 'off')
%     which causes Simulink not to ask whether or not the model is to be
%     saved, as was previously the case.


%   Version 2.3     03.01.2024, D. Kiehn
%   - Added the names of trim variables and trim requirements to the
%     infostruct output.


%   Version 2.2     25.02.2022, D. Kiehn
%   - Fixed a bug which caused the model not to be terminated in case the
%     trim failed due to hard bounds (i.e., exit code 5)
%   - It is now verified that the target cost function (cost_tbg) is non-negative.
%   - Added a note about the risks of directly using the trim result (as an array)
%     for the initialization of a model


%   Version 2.1     05.08.2021, D. Kiehn
%   - Fixed a bug which caused the step direction to change sign in case
%     the step had to be truncated to avoid violating the lower bounds
%     (X_MIN or U_MIN).
%   - OPTIONS can now be passed as an empty element.


%   Version 2.0     22.07.2020, D. Kiehn
%   - Individual checking of max. iteration step sizes and max. perturbations
%     for linearization.
%   - The suppression of the array initialization warning is now done via
%     try/catch to ensure compatibility with older Matlab versions.
%   - Added automatic bisection if the sensitivity matrix loses full rank
%     (but was initialized with full rank) - useful in case a saturation is
%     reached during the trimming process.
%   - The OPTIONS input is now a structure which can be used to
%       - control if/how to compile the Simulink model, granting the
%         ability to use precompiled models,
%       - define the maximum number of iterations and bisections,
%       - enable/disable all messages and warnings.
%   - Added optional inputs to specify fixed upper and lower boundaries for
%     states and inputs: X_MIN, X_MAX, U_MIN, U_MAX.
%   - Added optional output INFOSTRUCT with details about the trimming
%     process (progression of state/input vectors, cost function, Jacobian,
%     etc. over all iterations).
%   - Introduced a "fail-fast" philosophy: the function now returns an
%     error if it is called with nonsensical inputs, e.g. if the number of
%     trim variables doesn't match the number of trim requirements.
%   - Moved the model evaluation to new function getGeneralizedOutputVector
%
%   Note: default options of version 2.0 are those of jj_trim version 1.5
%         to maintain backward compatibility.


%   Version 1.5     07.11.2011, J. J. Buchholz
%
%   Array initialization warning suppressed.
%   Minor code optimizations.


%   Version 1.2.4   15.10.2008, W. Moennich
%
%   Comment added:
%   % The functionalities used here ('compile', 'term', ...)
%   % are documented in the Simulink manual under Simulation Commands/model
%   % and in Help(doc) unter Simulink/Functions/Simulation/model.


%   Version 1.2.3   20.05.2003, W. Moennich
%
%   Optional error flag as 5th output.


%   Version 1.2.2   26.09.2001, W. Moennich
%
%   Empty vectors now possible for DEL_X_MAX, DEL_U_MAX, DEL_X_LIN,
%   DEL_U_LIN.


%   Version 1.2.1   29.08.2001, W. Moennich
%
%   Check for maximum number of iterations moved inside the loop.


%   Version 1.2 	26.05.2000, J. J. Buchholz
%
%   The names of inputs, ... outputs for the error messages
%   are now transferred via the parameter list.
%
%   The precompilation and the release of the system is now done in JJ_TRIM.


%   Version 1.0     1998,       J. J. Buchholz
