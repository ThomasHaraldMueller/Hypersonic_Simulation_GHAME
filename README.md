# Hypersonic_Simulation_GHAME
Simulink implementation of the 6-DOF Generic Hypersonic Aerodynamic Model Example (GHAME)


## Overview

This repository contains a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom flight dynamics simulation of the Generic Hypersonic Aerodynamic Model Example (GHAME), implemented entirely in Simulink and MATLAB.

The model represents a rigid hypersonic vehicle including full translational and rotational dynamics, Earth kinematics, aerodynamic force and moment modeling, propulsion effects, actuator dynamics, and a configurable inertial navigation system (INS). It is designed as a research and control development platform tool.

The simulation architecture is modular and structured to allow systematic analysis, controller design, uncertainty studies, and verification.
